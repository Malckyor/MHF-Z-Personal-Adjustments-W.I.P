# MHF-Z-Personal-Adjustments-W.I.P.
This is just some personal adjustments I'm doing to MHF-Z by myself for some personal reasons. So this is just a patch that I see necessary for myself and of course is just a W.I.P. that I might end up not finishing if some criteria that I'm thinking meet it. I also am aware of my own skills so I won't give anyone hope about anything. As said, this is some personal work mainly for myself and I know that some people might be interested and then I'm sharing this.

## Why are you doing this?
Simply because I want, it hurts so much in my soul to play the game like it was. A lot of content is simply skipped, this is not the same game I started back in 2011. Plus I'm determined enough to do this and improve it way more than this!

## But Fist is doing/done it, why don't you wait?
Personally I disagree with at least 90% of what Fist stated in that rebalancement system of his, the only points I agree are the ones I consider myself a necessity, like returning some system back to a previous state of the game. Also if I have some knowledge and can do things myself, why should I wait? I disagree with a lot of stuff, but I respect everyone and I hope everyone else can respect me as well.

## Now that I justified the above I'll tell everything about this:

* No cheat, no, never, don't even complain!

* The most time consuming work here is the armour's upgrade system, I've been working for the last weeks to revert them back, of course this is not finished and I'll be working more on those, unless... For now rest assured that I did all the "normal", Goushu and Exotic armours, aside from the Exotic and 2 Goushu monsters the rest are all the original upgrades from a previous version and I even might need to work on that, if you find anything wrong with those just tell me, it takes so long doing this alone and it's worse not having any tool to work with this, but whatever.

* More key quests were added to the quest list. The intention behind this is to try to make everybody enjoy a bit more of the HR which was the main content of this game for so many years, there are a lot of content there but if you play it like it was left you'll simply skip it like it was nothing.

* I added some restriction to early GR content that would make everybody skips it, again I want everybody to experience and enjoy the game as much as we can, so no skipping! Tied to that I modified something in the Navi, you won't even notice the changes there.

* I didn't lock the GR content behind key quests or GR level because it wasn't locked before, I can do that though, but I don't like that idea since we could do almost everything with the exception of the Burst/Origin and eventually the Exotic and since there is the Z content it would be really weird... Anyway, the Exotic is now accessible at GR300!

* Zenith content was pushed far to the end of the GR, Zenith 1 starts now at GR600, Zenith 2 is now GR700, Zenith 3 is now GR800 and Zenith 4 is now GR900. Don't need to rush to this content, personally it lacks a lot to be really worth it, sure it is nice to play and all but it's just not enough and you should go and play the GR and enjoy the other 160 monsters of the game instead of just 24.

## Last notes...
This is shared of free will and all the work here was done by myself alone, anyone can have these files and use them how they see fit.

Most of you might not even want this for any reason and all, so this shouldn't be forced onto people either.

This may be only for, perhaps crazy, people like me that likes it this way.

Lastly how everyone play is not my fault, people that want to cheat, skip or something like that will always do that no matter which game or whatever, if you are going to do this then simply don't use this patch, but for those that will use it, I hope they enjoy "some" of the original system content as much as I do.
